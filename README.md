<em>Mathematica_Notebooks</em> 
=====================

The purpose of this repository is to manage and share my personal <em>Mathematica</em> Notebooks of different versions...
---

The notebooks will range from verisons 8 - 10 of <em>Mathematica</em>
* Most of the notebooks where scratch notebooks that I have used for various projects...
* I am trying to have them accesible to reuse some throw away functions that I could later need...
* I am trying also to see and correct my <em>Mathematica</em> programming habits and having my notebooks in one place makes that a little less difficult...
